# ðŸ“˜ Learn English Words as ESL

## Description

This project provides an engaging and practical way for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners to build their vocabulary. Rather than memorizing words in isolation, learners explore vocabulary in contextâ€”such as through real-world topics like casino games, conversations, and common scenarios.

Our goal is to make learning English more enjoyable and effective by connecting words to situations that learners may already be curious about.

## Why?

- ðŸŽ¯ Make English learning relevant and engaging.
- ðŸ§  Improve long-term retention through contextual learning.
- ðŸ’¬ Help ESL learners understand how words are used in real situations.

Whether youâ€™re an ESL student, a teacher, or a developer interested in educational tools, this project aims to bring vocabulary to life through interesting content.
